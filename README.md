# ApiHandling
this is a simple Webpage where i use a api that generates a random user on every get request 
I take the data from that api using the fetch method along with the async await function 
Then convert the fetched data into the json format so that i can refer to data as key value pairs
then i add a basic HTML body with some CSS
then Target a paticular HTML object by DOM manupilation in javascript and modyfing the content inside it
So each time we refresh the webpage we get details of a Random User
